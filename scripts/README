There are 2 scripts,

- validate.sh
- analyse.sh

Both run the same source, but with different inputs. The instructions for
running the scripts can be obtained by running them without command line
arguments.

However, there are things that needs to be modified within the
scripts to make them work for different cases:

- The SRC-variable within the scripts must be given a string that points
  to the src-directory.
- If one wants to change the corepart-variable of the plyfit-executable,
  it can be done by giving a different corepart-variable. These variables
  are listed within the script.
- If there are problems with exponentiation, the explim-variable, given for
  the plyfit-executable within the script must be given a lower value, but
  higher or equal to the value <fit-range>*<lat-vec>.
- The volumes and number of electrons for the lithium and silicon cells that
  have PCF data available in the examples-directory are listed within the
  analyse.sh-script.
